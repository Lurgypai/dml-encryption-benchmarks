use ./build\_image.sh to generate build the image

use ./run\_image.sh to run an interactive container

I haven't setup automatic running of anything since I'm just testing, so you have to go into benchmarks/lifeboat within the image and run the benchmark using the run\_lifeboat.sh script (usage ./run\_lifeboat.sh \<config\>).
